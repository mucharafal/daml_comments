You think type alias, or something like `SourceShape2` (also in this PR)? Words, more code...\r\n\r\nI don't like redefining shapes, but I think adding methods implicitly to replace names like `out1` might be useful. What do you think of that?\r\n\r\n> The single element initial state stream also feels slightly weird to me but I don’t have a better solution for that unfortunately.\r\n\r\nIn general variants of `Inlet` and `Outlet` limited to exactly one element would be a useful abstraction in several ways, but not something we can add ourselves, I think. We cope with this lack of distinction in JSON API's streams, too. It is unfortunate.",
