Any other sort of metric is number based, which means we would have to convert the offset (array[long]) to a single number. Therefore I think using the gauge is more appropriate.\r\nDisclaimer: the value of the gauge is not actively pushed. it is up to the configured metrics reporter to poll the gauge at some interval.",

        "body" : "What you put into the disclaimer was what I was mostly interested in. \r\n\r\nI was wondering about the performance implications of this approach to gathering metrics, i.e. volatile var + poll. But then concluded myself that there is no free lunch and what you have done is probably as good as it gets. \"Active pushing\" or a \"volatile var\" both exert some form of protection of the state shared between the threads. Just wanted to confirm that this is also what you think.",
