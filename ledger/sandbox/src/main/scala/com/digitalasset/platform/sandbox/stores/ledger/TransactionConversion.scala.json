This lead to two (already existing) conformance tests failing, which were actually fixed by me no longing intersecting the parties with the witnesses. I don't know why that would be. I'll try to run some further tests and see if restoring the `stakeholder`s to their previous state works. Still, it would be unclear to me why those tests would fail, as I would expect the union of signatories intersected with witnesses and observers intersected with witnesses to be the same as stakeholders intersected with witnesses, unless I'm missing something in how stakeholders are exposed as transaction nodes.",
