Both of these seem bad, but the latter seems worse IMO.\r\n\r\nI don't know a way around this other than re-invoking daml-assistant for the necessary component with a modified DAML_SDK_VERSION, in the cases where the platform version /= SDK version. I.e. we shouldn't be invoking jars across SDK versions directly.\r\n\r\nIf the former, how often do logback configs change? Does running an SDK component with a different logback config affect our ability to hit compatibility targets? My guess is no...\r\n\r\nWe should try really hard to avoid getting into a situation that makes it difficult to change the SDK / platform in the future.",
