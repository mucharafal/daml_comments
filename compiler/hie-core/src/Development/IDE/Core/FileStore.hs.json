It seems like we have turned a single API call `setBufferModified` that handled the switch internally into two API calls `setBufferModified`, `setSomethingModified` the latter of which is partial and now the caller needs to figure out which one they want to use. If we go for this, we probably want to at least have a comment here explaining the difference.",
