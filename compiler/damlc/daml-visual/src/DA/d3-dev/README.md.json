I spent two days trying to use the latest version but matching up version of libs and the base libs are not documented yet there are some pointers on google mailing list but I failed to reproduce it  (https://github.com/d3plus/) the ones we are interested are tooltips, legends, and network libs. Authors did not mention release dates so I ended up using the current stable version. Once it is released it should be a hard thing to integrate",

The reason we are not using latest(`2.0.0`) is the composition of libs is not very well documented and lacks advanced examples and also it is currently labeled as beta."
