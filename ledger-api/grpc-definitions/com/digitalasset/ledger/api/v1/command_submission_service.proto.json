As for `actions` not being defined, I suggested to @bethaitman to add a kind of glossary to the \"Building Applications\" docs. I think we should explain what `transactions`, `actions`, `events`, `commands`, `submissions` and `completions` are and how they relate to each other.\r\n\r\nI'm not adamant about using `action` here, but I do like relating things back to the ledger model. Ultimately, users need to understand the link between the commands they submit and the resulting transaction, both in terms of ledger model and in terms of event stream. The fact that API and Ledger Model use different terminology and that we have now even broken the 1-1 correspondence between `command` and `event`/`action` is rather unfortunate.",
