        "body" : "I think there are two usecases for a `daml_build` rule:\r\n\r\n1. Documentation for upgrading, packaging, …. In this case the `daml.yaml` is something displayed in the documentation and we want to test against that exact `daml.yaml` (see my comment above on the change to the `daml.yaml`). I think in that case we might be able to get away with something simpler: We can not shuffle sources around and instead just go to the directory of the `daml.yaml` and call `daml build`. If the files are arranged in the right locations I believe this should work out. The one thing that won’t work is finding the `dar` files. I don’t really have a great solution for that. idea. I don’t expect this usecase to ever become particularly common. ATM the upgrading docs are the only thing that would make use of this and I wonder if we might just be better off keeping the `sh_test` there to make sure we reproduce exactly what our documentation says. Curious what @aherrmann-da thinks about this.\r\n\r\n2. The other usecase is basically every single call to `daml_compile` in our codebase atm and things like the genrule for triggers or DAML script which cannot use `daml_compile`. I think in this case, we don’t want to specify a `daml.yaml` at all. Instead if probably makes sense for the Bazel rule to accept a list of DAR files as dependencies, a list of source files, a name, and maybe a `strip_prefix` field and then the rule will generate the `daml.yaml` automagically.\r\n\r\nI think the current rule is in a bit of an awkward middle ground where it doesn’t quite work for documentation since it requires modifying the `daml.yaml` but it’s also rather awkward to use outside of documentation since there it would be much more convenient to specify the `daml.yaml` directly in the rule. Given that 2 is much more common, I think it would make more sense to at least initially focus the rule on that and leave documentation like it is for now.",

So while I do agree that it’s nicer in terms of the code in the `BUILD.bazel` file, it’s worse in terms of the UX for someone reading the docs which is the important part here.
