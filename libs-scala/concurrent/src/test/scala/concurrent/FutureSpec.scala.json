        "body" : "Already mentioned this in the previous thread, but https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/7347#discussion_r489001143 for this PR.\r\n\r\nBut since you mentioned it again, I thought I would write down the case for not bothering with an explicit converter:\r\n\r\nThe analogy with Scala vs Java collections is faulty in important ways. That is because there are no operational differences between dc.Futures (the ones here) and sc.Futures, which is not true of, say, java.util.List vs scala.collection.mutable.Buffer (or any other choice you may have). You can view the subtyping hierarchy of ExecutionContext as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            sc.ExecutionContext\r\n                     |\r\n                     |\r\n          dc.ExecutionContext[Any]\r\n                /           \\\r\n               /             \\\r\ndc.ExecutionContext[<complete *-kinded type lattice>]\r\n               \\             /\r\n                \\           /\r\n        dc.ExecutionContext[Nothing]\r\n```\r\n\r\nComparably, *structurally*, the only difference between an sc.Future and dc.Future is which subset of the above types you accept as a context argument:\r\n\r\n```\r\n          dc.Future[Nothing]\r\n            /           \\\r\n           /             \\\r\ndc.Future[<inverted *-kinded type lattice>]\r\n           \\             /\r\n            \\           /\r\n            dc.Future[Any]\r\n                  |\r\n                  |\r\n              sc.Future\r\n```\r\n\r\n(more specific types are lower, wider types are higher, for both graphs)\r\n\r\nWith the top of the Future hierarchy accepting only the bottom of the ExecutionContext hierarchy, each more specific Future accepting a broader, less specific set of ExecutionContexts, until you reach dc.Future[Any] which accepts any dc.ExecutionContext, and then finally the bottom of the Future hierarchy, which is the only one that accepts the top of the ExecutionContext hierarchy (and indeed all other ExecutionContexts).\r\n\r\nExplicit conversion barriers between Scala collections and Java collections, or Scala futures and Java futures for that matter, are desirable because they cannot have a relationship meeting the Liskov Substitution Principle.  They have different dynamic behavior, so neither can be a substitute for the other, i.e. there exist functions on each that simply do not work on the other.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, _all_ functions that operate on a dc.Future[..., T] argument are also functions that operate on a sc.Future argument in the exact same way; LSP holds, there are no dynamic behavior differences at all, and the only difference is the type of ExecutionContext it accepts (which is a contravariant position).\r\n\r\nHonestly I tried to actually reify this type relationship directly in Scala, but the specifics were too tricky to immediately resolve. It is worth further noting, however, that whereas `ScalaConversions` require fancy wrappers (which may have bugs) with special runtime characteristics of their own, the conversion here literally does nothing. That is what you'd expect, given that there is nothing about reifying the type relationship that would cause any particular problems for implementation.\r\n\r\nIt being that an implicit conversion that does nothing is significantly less likely to cause trouble than one that does something, I'd like to see whether it actually causes any problems in practice before assuming it does and adding burdens to anyone who might want to try porting sc.Future code to interact with dc.Futures.",
