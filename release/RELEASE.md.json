The instructions as written _would_ produce release notes for each alpha version, but the docs (and hence release notes) would only get published to docs.daml.com on stable releases. If followed, the current instructions would yield a release notes file with a series of entries for alpha releases and then an empty entry for the final release (provided it is just promoting the latest alpha to stable).\r\n\r\nMy current thinking (but this is very much up for debate) is that we should update the release notes file to have an entry for the latest alpha release. On a new alpha release, we should update that entry (i.e. not keep the old one if it was already an alpha), and when doing a stable release we should just change the title of the last entry.",
