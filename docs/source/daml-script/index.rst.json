Instead of specifying a ``scenario`` field in your ``daml.yaml``,\n    you need to specify an ``init-script`` field. The initialization\n    script is specified via ``Module:identifier`` for both fields.\n-#. DAML script only supports the commands available on the ledger API\n-   so you cannot call functions like ``fetch`` directly. This is\n-   intentional. Your initialization scripts should not be able to\n-   create transactions that a ledger client would not be able to\n-   create. If you want to call methods not exposed via the Ledger API,\n-   you can create a new template with a single choice\n-   and call that via ``createAndExercise``.\n-#. You need to replace calls to ``getParty x`` by\n-   ``allocatePartyWithHint x (PartyIdHint x)``.\n+#. In DAML script, ``submit`` and ``submitMustFail`` are limited to\n+   the functionality provided by the ledger API: A list of independent\n+   commands consisting of ``createCmd``, ``exerciseCmd``,\n+   ``createAndExerciseCmd`` and ``exerciseByKeyCmd``. There are two\n+   issues you might run into when migrating an existing scenario:\n+\n+   #. Your commands depend on each other, e.g., you use the result of\n+      a ``create`` within a following command in the same\n+      ``submit``. In this case, you have two options: If it is not\n+      important that they are part of the translation, simply split\n+      them into multiple calls to ``submit``. If you do need them to\n+      be within the same transaction, you can move the logic to a\n+      choice and call that using ``createAndExerciseCmd``.\n+\n+   #. You use something that is not part of the 4 ledger API command\n+      types, e.g., ``fetch``. For ``fetch`` and ``fetchByKey``, you\n+      can instead use ``queryContractId`` and ``queryContractKey``\n+      with the caveat that they do not run within the same\n+      transaction. Other types of ``Update`` statements can be moved\n+      to a choice that you call via ``createAndExerciseCmd``.\n+#. Instead of Scenario’s ``getParty``, DAML Script provides you with\n+   ``allocateParty`` and ``allocatePartyWithHint``. There are a few\n+   important differences:\n+\n+   #. Allocating a party always gives you back a new party (or\n+      fails). If you have multiple calls to ``getParty`` with the same\n+      string and expect to get back the same party, you should instead\n+      allocate the party once at the beginning and pass it along to\n+      the rest of the code.\n+\n+   #. If you want to allocate a party with a specific party id, you\n+      can use ``allocatePartyWithHint x (PartyIdHint x)``. Note that\n+      while this is supported in DAML Studio and DAML on SQL, other\n+      ledgers can behave differently and ignore the party id hint or\n+      interpret it another way. Try not to rely on any specific"

This\n+means that you cannot use scenarios to test other ledger clients,\n+e.g., your UI or :doc:`DAML triggers </triggers/index>`.\n+\n+DAML script addresses this problem by providing you with an API with\n+the simplicity of DAML scenarios and all the benefits such as being\n+able to reuse your DAML types and logic while running against an\n+actual ledger. This means that you can use it to test automation\n+logic, your UI but also for ledger initialization where scenarios\n+cannot be used (with the exception of :doc:`/tools/sandbox`).\n+\n+Usage\n+=====\n+\n+Our example for this tutorial consists of 2 templates.\n+\n+First, we have a template called ``Coin``:\n+\n+.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml\n+   :language: daml\n+   :start-after: -- COIN_TEMPLATE_BEGIN\n+   :end-before: -- COIN_TEMPLATE_END\n+\n+This template represents a coin issued to ``owner`` by ``issuer``.\n+``Coin`` has both the ``owner`` and the ``issuer`` as signatories.\n+\n+Second, we have a template called ``CoinProposal``:\n+\n+.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/src/ScriptExample.daml\n+   :language: daml\n+   :start-after: -- COIN_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE_BEGIN\n+   :end-before: -- COIN_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE_END\n+\n+``CoinProposal`` is only signed by the ``issuer`` and it provides a\n+single ``Accept`` choice which, when exercised by the controller will\n+create the corresponding ``Coin``.\n+\n+Having defined the templates, we can now move on to write DAML scripts\n+that operate on these templates. To get accees to the API used to implement DAML scripts, you need to add the ``daml-script``\n+library to the ``dependencies`` field in ``daml.yaml``.\n+\n+.. literalinclude:: ./template-root/daml.yaml.template\n+   :start-after: # script-dependencies-begin\n+   :end-before: # script-dependencies-end\n+\n+In addition to that you also need to import the ``Daml.Script`` module\n+and since DAML script provides ``submit`` and ``submitMustFail``\n+functions that collide with the ones used in scenarios, we need to\n+hide those. We also enable the ``ApplicativeDo`` extension.

The second argument\n+must be of type ``Commands a`` so in our case ``Commands (ContractId\n+CoinProposal, ContractId CoinProposal, ContractId CoinProposal)``\n+corresponding to the 3 proposals that we create. ``Commands`` is\n+similar to ``Update`` which is used in the ``submit`` function in\n+scenarios.
