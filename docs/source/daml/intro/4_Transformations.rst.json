Exercises come in two kinds called ``consuming`` and ``nonconsuming``. ``consuming`` is the default kind and changes the contract's status from *active* to *archived*.\n- A ``key assertion`` records the assertion that the given contract key (see :ref:`contract_keys`) is not assigned to any active contract on the ledger.\n\nEach action can be visualized as a tree, where the action is the root node, and its children are its consequences. Every consequence may have further consequences. As ``fetch``, ``create`` and ``key assertion`` actions have no consequences, they are always leaf nodes. You can see the actions and their consequences in the transaction view of the above scenario:"
