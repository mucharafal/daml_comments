Currently, that best-effort means lookups only return contracts if the submitting Party is a stakeholder of that contract.\n\nIn particular, the above means that if multiple commands are submitted simultaneously, all using contract lookups to find and consume a given contract, there will be contention between these commands, and at most one will succeed."
