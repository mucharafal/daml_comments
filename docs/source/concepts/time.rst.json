        "body" : "Some thinking out loud: I'm wondering what the best way to link this to the ledger model is. The model has a notion of a commit, and the `lt/rt` would in reality be assigned to commits. I don't think it's urgent to change/solve it for this PR, as I think that just saying \"transaction\" will be sufficiently understandable.\r\n\r\nChanging lt/rt to refer to commits also introduces problems, though, since the ledger model also has a notion of projections, which are just transactions, but we still want to assign these timestamps to them. I see a couple of ways out:\r\n1. we assign the timestamps to both a commit and to every action in the commit, with all actions within a single commit having the same timestamp\r\n2. we change the notion of a projection to be a commit, though this one is tricky, as we have to figure out what to do with requesters, such that we don't mess the authorization definitions up (likely: a commit would then have to allow for a different requester for each top-level action in the commit).",
