The file should be located in your ``Home`` folder.\n+In ``Finder`` click on Go --> Home and then click ``Cmd+SHIFT+.`` to see the hidden files. Locate the ``~/.bash_profile``\n+and double click on it to open it. Add the folloiwing line as a new line at the end of the file::\n+\n+        export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)\n+\n+Save the file before closing.\n+\n+Next open the terminal and run the source command to apply the changes::\n+\n+        source ~/.bash_profile\n+\n+Check the ``JAVA_HOME`` variable and make sure that the changes have been applied::\n+\n+        echo $JAVA_HOME\n+\n+The result should be the path to the JDK installation, something like this::\n+\n+        /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk_version_number/Contents/Home\n+\n+Setting the PATH variable\n+=========================\n+Open the ``~/.bash_profile`` in any text editor. Add the following line as a new line at the\n+end of the file::\n+\n+        export PATH=\"~/.daml/bin:$PATH\"\n+\n+Save the file before closing.\n+\n+Next open the terminal and run the source command to apply the changes::\n+\n+        source ~/.bash_profile\n+\n+To check if DAML has been added to your ``PATH`` variable run::\n+\n+        daml version\n+\n+which should list out all installed DAML SDK version as well as the project default one.

Open ``Search`` and type \"advanced system settings\" and hit ``Enter``.\n+2. Find the ``Advanced`` tab and click on the ``Environment Variables``.\n+3. In the ``System variables`` section click on ``New`` if you want to set ``JAVA_HOME`` system wide. To set ``JAVA_HOME`` for a single user click on ``New`` under ``User variables``.\n+4. In the opened modal window for ``Variable name`` type ``JAVA_HOME`` and for the ``Variable value`` set the path to the JDK installation. Click OK once you're done.\n+5. Click OK and click Apply to apply the changes.\n+\n+Setting the PATH variable\n+=========================\n+If you have downloaded and installed the DAML SDK using our `Windows installer <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/releases/latest>`_ your ``PATH`` variable is already set up.\n+\n+Mac OS\n+******\n+We'll explain here how to set up ``JAVA_HOME`` and ``PATH`` variables on Mac OS with ``zsh`` console.\n+If you are using ``bash`` all of the instructions are quite similar, except that you will be doing all of the changes\n+in the ``.bash_profile`` file.\n+\n+Setting the JAVA_HOME variable\n+==============================\n+Run the following command in your terminal::\n+\n+        echo \"export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)\" >> ~/.zprofile\n+\n+In order for the changes to take effect you will need to restart your computer. Note that if you will be setting up the\n+``PATH`` variable as well you can restart your computer after you're done with all the changes. Upon restarting check that\n+the ``JAVA_HOME`` variable is set::\n+\n+        echo $JAVA_HOME\n+\n+The result should be the path to the JDK installation, something like this::\n+\n+        /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk_version_number/Contents/Home\n+\n+Setting the PATH variable\n+=========================\n+Run the following command in your terminal::\n+\n+        echo 'export PATH=\"~/.daml/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.zprofile\n+\n+Restart the terminal for the changes to take effect. Upon restarting check the ``PATH`` variable and make sure that"
