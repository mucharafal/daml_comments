SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n+\n+Manually installing the SDK\n+***************************\n+\n+If you require a higher level of security, you can instead install the SDK by manually downloading the compressed tarball, verifying its signature, extracting it and manually running the install script.\n+\n+Note that the Windows installer is already signed (within the binary itself), and that signature is checked by Windows before starting it. Nevertheless, you can still follow the steps below to check its external signature file.\n+\n+To do that:\n+\n+1. Go to https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/releases. Confirm your browser sees a valid certificate for the github.com domain.\n+2. Download the artifact (*Assets* section, after the release notes) for your platform as well as the corresponding signature file. For example, if you are on macOS and want to install release 0.13.27, you would download the files ``daml-sdk-0.13.27-macos.tar.gz`` and ``daml-sdk-0.13.27-macos.tar.gz.asc``. Note that for Windows you can choose between the tarball, which follows the same instructions as the Linux and macOS ones (but assumes you have a number of typical Unix tools installed), or the installer, which ends with ``.exe``. Regardless, the steps to verify the signature are the same."
