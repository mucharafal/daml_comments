We will provide you with the template for a miniature social networking app, get you writing your first end-to-end feature and finally deploy your new app to a persistent ledger.\n+\n+By the end of the tutorial, you should have an idea of what DAML contracts and ledgers are, how the UI interacts with them, and how you might solve a potential use case with a DAML-driven solution. We do not aim to give a comprehensive guide to all DAML concepts and tools; for that, see the later sections of the documentation. With that, let's get started!\n+\n+.. TODO: reference specific sections of docs instead of saying \"later sections\".\n+\n+.. toctree::\n+   :hidden:\n+\n+   app-architecture\n+   first-feature\n+\n+Prerequisites\n+*************\n+\n+If you haven't already, see :doc:`installation` for the DAML SDK and VSCode development environment.\n+\n+You will also need some common software tools to build and interact with the template project.\n+\n+- `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ version control system\n+- `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/>`_ package manager for Javascript\n+- A terminal application for command line interaction\n+\n+\n+Running the app\n+***************\n+\n+We'll start by getting the app up and running, and then explain the different components which we will later extend.\n+\n+First off, open a terminal, clone the template project and move to the project folder::\n+\n+    git clone https://github.com/digital-asset/create-daml-app.git\n+    cd create-daml-app\n+\n+In order to connect the DAML model to the UI code, we need to run a code generation step (more on this later)::\n+\n+    daml build\n+    daml codegen ts .daml/dist/create-daml-app-0.1.0.dar -o daml-ts/src\n+\n+Now, use Yarn to install the project dependencies and build the app::\n+\n+    yarn install\n+    yarn workspaces run build\n+\n+You should see ``Compiled successfully.`` in the output if everything is working as expected.\n+\n+.. TODO: Give instructions for possible failures.\n+\n+We can now run the app in two steps.\n+You'll need two terminal windows running for this.\n+\n+In one terminal, at the root of the ``create-daml-app`` directory, run the script::\n+\n+    ./daml-start.sh\n+\n+This compiles the DAML component of the project and starts a *Sandbox* ledger for the app.\n+The ledger in this case is stored in the Sandbox application memory; it is not persistent but is useful for testing and development.\n+We'll leave the Sandbox running to serve requests from the UI, which result in changes to the in-memory ledger.\n+\n+In a second terminal, navigate to the ``create-daml-app/ui`` folder and run::\n+\n+    yarn start\n+\n+This starts the UI application connected to the already running Sandbox.\n+The command should automatically open a window in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.\n+If it doesn't, just open that link in any web browser.\n+You may be asked whether to allow the app to receive network connections, which you should allow.\n+\n+At this point you should see the login page for the social network.\n+\n+.. TODO: Screenshot\n+\n+Enter a user name of your choice and click the calculator icon next to the password field to generate a password token.\n+(We do not have proper authentication in this app for simplicity.)\n+Once you click \"Sign up\", you can see a screen with panels for your friends and the entire social network.\n+Initially these are both empty as you don't have any friends yet!\n+Go ahead and add some using the form (and remove them using the cross icons if you change your mind).\n+\n+Now let's grow the network. Log out and sign up using the name of one of your friends."
