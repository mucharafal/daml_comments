However there is one advantage that becomes relevant once your project reaches a certain age (i.e. number of upgrades):\r\n\r\nSince a a DAR is always self-contained, keeping the upgrades and the new models together means that your DAR will get bigger and bigger since you can never drop old versions even if you write something that only references the new models, e.g., a trigger that only cares about the models of a specific version. If you keep it separate on the other hand, your trigger can only depend on the new models.",
